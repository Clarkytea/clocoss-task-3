# CLOCOSS Task 3

It passes all tests written by @jacekkopecky (woohoo!)

## Installation instructions

Clone this repo, then simply run `gcloud app deploy` in the root directory.

## Things to note

This app currently uses an in-memory data store. This means **resetting the service will lose existing data**.
